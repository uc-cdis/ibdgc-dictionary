Notes recorded in the process of developing the initial data model for the
IBDGC data commons:

- For the moment, we are not editing the Program and Project nodes, though
  they will likely require some revision for the IBDGC.

- How should LCLs be represented in data model?

- How to link workflow to Broad's pipeline?
